# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This repository demonstrates digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It contains two approaches:  A basic neural network for digit classification and a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for improved accuracy.  Both notebooks show the complete workflow from data preprocessing to training, evaluation, and prediction.
