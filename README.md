# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This repository demonstrates digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It contains two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Fully Connected Neural Network (MLP):** A basic neural network approach for digit classification.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A more advanced model inspired by a research paper, leveraging convolutional layers for improved accuracy.
